# Doggobot
Finds images on Imgur based on given criteria and posts to Twitter with specified text. This uses the `imgurpython`, `tweepy`, and `BeautifulSoup 4` libraries. This is meant for educational purposes only and is not intended to be used as an actual spambot. It started as a joke between a few friends of mine saying that I was going to make a fleet of bots and take over twitter with dogs. I made a bot, and this is it. It is free to use under the MIT license.
# Prerequisites
- You need `bs4`, `future`, `imgurpython` and `tweepy` installed
- If on Windows, you need [WGet](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) for Windows
