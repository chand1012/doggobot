# doggobot
Finds images on Imgur based on given criteria and posts to Twitter with specified text. This uses the `imgurpython`, `tweepy`, and `BeautifulSoup 4` libraries. This is meant for educational purposes only and is not intended to be used as an actual spambot. It started as a joke between a few friends of mine saying that I was going to make a fleet of bots and take over twitter with dogs. I made a bot, and this is it. It is free to use under the MIT license.
